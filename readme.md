# Project overview

The purpose of this application is to allow users to get familiar with how 
trading stocks works and also to test and experiment with trends, buy adding stocks to portfolios.
the user will be able to track their portfolio growth over time. the app uses data from  a 3rd party 
API from https://finnhub.io/login. this API has plenty of information that can be pulled and used such as "time series" data
"company info" and "quotes" this app currently uses "symbol" data from the API and "qoute" data. 
    Some limations that I experienced during this project was that I did not have strong plan  for the type of data
that I eas going to use. Also doing more in-depth research on the stock Trading before getting starting the project would've 
helped out my overall functionality.

# stretch goals
